  RoofWrap Caulk Tape is a heavy butyl mastic, flexible putty tape. It is non-hardening, waterproof and pliable.  After it is applied, Caulk Tape increases in adhesion with age.

<h3>Basic Uses</h3>

<p>
  RoofWrap Caulk Tape is specifically recommended for use with RoofWrap roof mounted vent flashings. Caulk Tape is installed to the underside of the metal flange's outside edge. Clean the Roofwrap surface with a non-soap household spray cleaner and wipe dry with damp cloth. When the vent is installed, the Caulk Tape adheres and compresses onto the cleaned membrane forming a weatherproof seal. The recommended service temperatures are between -30F and 200F; best results if applied at temperatures between 45-85 F on dry surfaces.
