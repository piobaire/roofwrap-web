<h3>Application Instructions</h3>

<p>
  Follow the instructions as outlined in the current RoofWrap Installation Guide.
</p>

<p>
  Using supplied Scotch-BriteÂ® scrub pads, clean the area of the membrane to receive the tape thoroughly with RoofWrap Tape Primer and allow to dry. Roll out the cover tape and center over the area to be covered. Starting at one end, peel back the release liner approximately 12". Carefully position the tape, center first. When working with two people sealing full length field seams, lift the cover tape and peel back the release liner approximately 10' at a time without stretching the tape. The second person should smooth the cover tape over the area to be covered. Then, using a 2" steel roller, roll the Cover Tape running the roller perpendicular to the length of the tape. Lap Sealant is only required at the cut ends of the tape and overlaps.
