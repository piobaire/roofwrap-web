<p>
  RoofWrap "Acrylic Water Base Bonding Adhesive" (WBA) is an acrylic latex-based adhesive with superior bonding performance.  The product is white in color when wet and is clear when dry.  The solids content is approximately 60%, and the overall texture is similar to latex paint.
</p>

<h3>Basic Use</h3>
<p>
  <em>Single Side Adhesive:</em>  Can only be used as a single-side adhesive when applying over porous surfaces such as plywood, OSB, Dens-Deck, wood and high-density fiberboard.  Single-side application is when the adhesive is only applied to one surface (normally the substrate) and the sheet is immediately rolled in place into the white, wet adhesive.  When applied as a single-side adhesive, the EPDM membrane may be moved and adjusted to remove any wrinkles.  Working time before set-up takes place is approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  As this product is water based and contains no solvents, actual drying time is dependent on temperature and humidity.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Contact Adhesive:</em>  Can be used as a contact adhesive over non-porous or porous surfaces.  This application requires the adhesive to be put on both surfaces to be adhered: then the adhesive is left to tack dry before mating the surfaces.  Can be used on metal, concrete or certain sealed horizontal surfaces.  It may also be used as a contact adhesive on approved foam roof insulation boards with acceptable facers.
</p>

<h3>Product Benefits</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Non-flammable and non-toxic</li>
  <li>Once set, will not break down when immersed in water for prolonged periods of time.</li>
  <li>Application temperature performance is satisfactory above 45 F and below 90 F.</li>
  <li>Installs easily and smoothly, which speeds installation.</li>
  <li>Can be re-sealed in container without set taking place.</li>
  <li>Available in 1 gallon pails, 5 gallon pails and 55 gallon drums.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>
  The estimated (theoretical) coverage rates at room temperature are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Porous surfaces, 100 to 120 square feet per gallon (1 side application)</li>
  <li>Non-porous surfaces, 50 to 60 square feet per gallon (2 side application)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Application</h3>

<p>
  Can be sprayed, rolled or brushed on almost any acceptable substrate. Product must be stirred thoroughly before use.
</p>

<h3>Installation Temperature</h3>

<p>
  Do not use adhesive if ambient temperature is below 45 F or if night time temperatures are expected to fall below 40 F within 48 hours after application.  If installation timing cannot comply with these requirements, consider using RoofWrap Bonding Adhesive.  See RoofWrap Installation Guide for details.
</p>

<p>
  Do not install in very hot weather where the adhesive is drying before the membrane can be installed.  The adhesive should be wet and white as the membrane is laid.  If there is a concern of premature drying, lift up a section of the membrane to see if the bottom side is properly wet with adhesive.  If not, pull back a reapply with more adhesive.
</p>

<p> <em>
  CAUTION:  Product must be stored above 60 F.  The product cannot be used once frozen.  Do not let RoofWrap Water Base Bonding Adhesive freeze.  It is difficult to clean up when spilled on unrelated surfaces if left to dry.  (See MSDS for more information).
</em> </p>

<h3>Clean up</h3>

<p>
  The adhesive can be removed from hands when wet with water and a light detergent.  When dry, use a solvent followed by soap and water.
</p>

<p>
  With spray equipment, use water followed by solvent cleaners, followed by water with detergent.  Paint roller covers can be left in material until next usage, tightly sealed in plastic bags  or cleaned with water when wet.
</p>

<p>
  Material spillage can be removed easily with water when wet.   If adhesive has dried, peel off as much surface adhesive as possible and clean area with solvent until removed.
</p>

<h3>Hybrid-Adhered Installation over Plywood or OSB</h3>

<p>
  For installations in Medium and High Wind regions (as selected during information input on this site's "Online Price Calculator") use Acrylic Water Base Bonding Adhesive onto thinner thickness, 12" wide plywood or OSB sheathing strip(s) that have been mechanically attached (screwed) to the existing roof deck at its roof trusses which are normally 24" on center. After the RoofWrap membrane is been laid in place and allowed to relax, pull the half the membrane back to expose the sheathing strips. Apply the adhesive onto the strips at a coverage rate of 100-125 lineal feet per gallon. When freshly applied, the adhesive should be a light, milky white. Lay the membrane into the wet adhesive as soon as possible. This ensures the wetting of the membrane's bottom surface.
</p>

<p>
  Once half of the sheet is in place, use a push broom to sweep the adhered surface, keeping a steady pressure with the broom against the surface of the sheet, mating surfaces and eliminating captured air between the membrane and the strip. If the sheet is critically out of intended position, lift the sheet up to the problem location. A reapplication of adhesive is usually necessary.
</p>

<p>
  Repeat the procedure on the other half of the roof.
</p>

<p>
  Minor wrinkles will not negatively affect RoofWrap's service life.
</p>

<h3>Fully-Adhered Installation over a Full Plywood/OSB  Roof Deck Surface</h3>

<p>
  Once the RoofWrap membrane has been positioned and given sufficient time to relax, fold half the membrane back onto itself exposing the new, roof deck surface. Starting at the fold, apply adhesive to deck only. As you proceed with the adhesive, feed the membrane into the wet, milky white adhesive. Lay the membrane into the wet adhesive as soon as possible ensuring the full wetting of the membrane's bottom surface.
</p>

<p>
  As the half the sheet is being laid in place, use a stiff push broom to sweep the roofing surface, keeping a steady pressure with the broom against the surface of the sheet, mating surfaces and eliminating captured air between the membrane and deck. Broom from the interior of the sheet to its outside perimeter. If the sheet is critically out of intended position, lift the sheet up as the problem occurs, and reposition it. A reapplication of adhesive is usually necessary.
</p>

<p>
  Repeat the procedure for the second half of the sheet.
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: Traffic footprints over freshly installed membrane should be minimized.  Footprints will be less visible once the adhesive cures. Minor wrinkles will not negatively affect RoofWrap's service life.
</p>

<h3>Fully-Adhered Installation Over Other, Non-Absorbent Roof Decks</h3>

<p>
  Place the RoofWrap membrane to the desired final position. Allow to relax, usually 15-30 minutes. Fold the membrane in half, lengthwise, onto itself exposing the roof deck surface.  Starting at the fold, apply RoofWrap Adhesive not only to the freshly cleaned deck but also to the backside of the exposed roof sheet. First apply adhesive on the membrane, then on the substrate. Usually 5'-10' size long sections can conveniently been done at a time.
</p>

<p>
  When both surfaces are dry to a tacky touch, the surface will be clear with very little to no white or wet adhesive showing. Gently feed the roofing back into place on the deck's adhesive, taking precaution not to capture air between the substrate and the sheet. Start feeding the roofing into the adhesive from the middle of the roll and working out in both directions. Once the section is in place, use a push broom to assure mating of the surfaces. Should a wrinkle appear that cannot be worked out with your hand or broom, slowly peel back the membrane, re-position the membrane and put it back in place. This should only be attempted immediately after setting the membrane and may require both surfaces to be re-glued. Using a push broom with pressure, sweep the troubled area assuring mating of the surfaces. Minor wrinkles will not negatively affect RoofWrap's service life. Repeat the procedure until each section is finished.  Apply the other half in the same manner.
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: Traffic over freshly adhered membrane should be minimized. Excessive pressure can displace the wet adhesive thereby negatively effecting its ability.
