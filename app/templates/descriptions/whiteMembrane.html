<h3>White-on-Black EPDM Membrane</h3>

<img src="img/white.membrane.jpg" alt="White EPDM Roof Membrane" width="280" height="200" />
<p>
  Roofwrap White-on-Black EPDM is a high performance non-reinforced membrane that stands up to tearing, impacts, punctures and normal roof traffic.  The elastomeric properties of the EPDM membrane compensate for thermal shock and building movement.  EPDM membranes provide excellent resistance to ozone and aging.  The membrane is manufactured in accordance with the guidelines established by the RMA (Rubber Manufacturers Association) and meets all government specifications as well as the ASTM Standard Specification D-4637 Energy Star Rated.
