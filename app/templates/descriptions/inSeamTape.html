<h3>Application Instructions</h3>

<p>
  After the EPDM membrane sheets have been positioned with a nominal 3" lap, take your chalk and make a line on overlapped membrane 1/2" away from the overlapping membrane edge. Next, fold back the top sheet approximately 12". Using the supplied Scotch-BriteÂ® scrub pad and RoofWrap Tape Primer, clean the underside of the top sheet lap area as well as the seam area of the bottom sheet up to the chalkline. Allow to dry. Next, unroll the seam tape onto the seaming area on the bottom sheet 1/4" in from the chalkline, leaving the release paper on. Using firm hand pressure, smooth the tape into place along the length of the seam. Remove the release liner by pulling at a 90 degree angle low and at roof level. The tape should be positioned so that the tape protrudes from the seam 1/8" to 3/8". As the release liner is being removed, roll the top sheet onto the seam and apply firm hand pressure, then use the 2" steel hand roller and roll the seam starting from the inside of the sheet working outward over the edge of the sheet perpendicular to the direction of the seam. Lap Sealant is required along the seam where the tape is overlapped in the seam (approximately 1.5" in each direction past the overlap).

<p>
  In warm, sunny weather, the tapes should be stored in the boxes in a shaded area until just prior to use. If the product becomes too hot, the smooth release of the tape may be affected. Prolonged storage temperatures in excess of 90 F(32 C) may affect the product's shelf life. Storage and use of tapes at temperatures below 40 F (4 C) will result in loss of tape tack, and may in extreme cases, result in a loss of bond to the EPDM material. Tapes should be maintained at a minimum temperature of 60 F (15 C) or average room temperature until just prior to installation.
