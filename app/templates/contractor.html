    <h2>Customers Love RoofWrap</h2>
    <hr />
    <p class="quote">I battled my  1972 single wide trailer roof for years using coatings.  A neighbor of mine bought a RoofWrap and recommended it.  Itâ€™s been 8 years and not a drop to be seen.  My two brothers and I put in on in less than a day.  Thanks RoofWrap!</p>

    <p class="quote">Our double wide got a White RoofWrap applied to it last month.  It looks great, no leaks and is quieter on the inside than before.  Our park handyman installed it and now has more orders.</p>
